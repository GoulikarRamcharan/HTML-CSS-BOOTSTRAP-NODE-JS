"Good morning everyone. I’m [Your Name], and I’m pleased to present our research titled ‘TrustCheck: Secured Banking Fraud Detection Using CatBoost and XGBoost.’
This work is submitted to the 5th International Conference for Intelligent Technologies, and is a joint effort by my co-authors and me from Anurag University."

Slide 2 – Introduction
"As digital transactions grow rapidly, financial fraud has become a major concern.
Traditional detection methods are outdated, slow, and often ineffective against modern fraud techniques.
We propose a real-time fraud detection system using two powerful machine learning models—CatBoost and XGBoost—capable of distinguishing fraudulent transactions using historical data."
